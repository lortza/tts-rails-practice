== README

This is a practice app using faker and populator to create a list of pets (critter), their humans (owner), and where they live. It uses seeds as well as faker data.

* Ruby version 2.2.1
* Rails version 4.2.1

It's currently rooted to the critters index, which displays a table of all of the critters. Each critter and owner name link to their show pages and heach sho page lists any related sub items (owners shows all critters, countries shows all owners, type shows all critters).

This app currently has no glitches.
